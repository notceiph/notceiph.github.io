Effortlessly converts musical keys and perfectly finds tone changes when changing project BPM with repitch/timestretch enabled

I've always found myself wondering about the relative minor of a sample or experimenting with changing the BPM to create exciting shifts in pitch and tempo. But with these changes, adjusting the vocals and other sounds to keep them in tune with the overall project used to take me five steps to get the new key/pitch. That's why I created this application - it's an all-in-one solution that automates this process, making it seamless and hassle-free. No more wasted time or frustration - just more time to focus on the creative process.
